# RobotArmController

First attempt to create a cross platform library for a robot arm with multiple servo's. Could be used to control
any amount of servo's. Not necessarily for a robot arm, could also be used to control servo's.

Some plans:

- record, save and edit movements of multiple servo's
- gcode
